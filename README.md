# Jetty-clustering
This project uses Python to perform cluster analysis on geospatial data. The dataset is a shapefile of points with X, Y coordinates and a Name column. The KMeans algorithm is used to perform the cluster analysis, and the number of clusters is determined using the elbow method. The clusters are visualized on a choropleth map using the geopandas library and a basemap is added using folium library. The final GeoDataFrame with the cluster labels included is saved as a CSV file. This project is well commented and easy to understand for beginners, it can be used as a starting point for similar projects and can be modified to suit specific needs.
